# Swappy

Swappy is an app that lets you post your used phone that you would like to trade in for a different phone of the same value. Simply create an account to be able to post your phone and browse the list of available swaps. When posting a phone, the user must enter the brand, the model, the condition and the IMEI number to ensure that it is a valid phone. We built this app in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**. We also used a few **Node Packages** like **Passport.js**, **Express** as well as a **MySQL Database**.
